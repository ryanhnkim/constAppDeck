## The US Construction Spending Tracker Overview

US Census provides monthly estimates of the total dollar value of construction work done in the U.S. 

This Web application pulls the latest data from the US Census website and automatically updates the charts. 

It also provides forecasted values of overall spending using ARIMA function based on the subset of data selected by user.
